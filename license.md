License Text: The MIT License requires that the original MIT License text or a copy of it be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This ensures that anyone who receives the software is aware of its terms.

Sublicensing: Users of software under the MIT License have the freedom to sublicense it under different terms, which means they can apply other open-source licenses to derivative works if they choose to do so.

Compatibility: The MIT License is known for its compatibility with other open-source licenses. Developers can often incorporate MIT-licensed code into projects with different licenses.

Popular Choice: Due to its simplicity and permissiveness, the MIT License is a popular choice for open-source projects, including libraries, frameworks, and applications.
